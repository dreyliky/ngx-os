            Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular CLI") is a
            TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by
            the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
            Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

            TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
            It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
            TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.
            As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
